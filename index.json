After all, it would be pointless to play around with lots of data just for the love of it, sometimes not but you get the point.\nData is gold, and the more you have the better off you are. However, raw unprocessed data is of no use unless you manipulate and gain insights from it. Before embarking on say statistical modelling and visualization of your data, it is very important to first have an understanding of the data itself. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aids in visualization, transformation, and generally cleaning or remodeling data before diving deep into information extraction.\nThere are no set rules to be followed when performing EDA. As a data preparation phase, one is allowed to decide what suits them best in order to gain an understanding of their data. However, there are two most important questions one should seek to answer while studying their data:\n\rIs there variation within my variables?\rIs there any correlation between my variables?\r\rThat being said, EDA involves the following checks among others:\n\rDescriptive Statistics - Gives a summarized understanding of the data, usually as measures of central tendency and variability.\r\rMean - Arithmetic average\rMedian - middle value\rMode - most frequent value\rStandard Deviation - variation from the mean\rKurtosis -peakedness of the data distribution\rSkewness - symmetry of the data distribution\r\rGroupings of data\rMissing values\rANOVA: Analysis of variance\rGraphical visualization, not restricted to:\r\rHistogram -frequency bar plots\rDensity estimation - an estimation if the frequency distribution based on sample data\rBox plots - A visual representation of median, quantiles, symmetry and ourtliers\rScatter plots - a graphical display of variables plotted on the x and y axes.\r\r\rIn this post, we will perform EDA on a sample data set containing responses to a mobile banking survey in Kenya. If you would like to follow along with the same data, you can download it here.\n\rData Importation\rThe code chunk below imports our data set into R.\n#Loading Data into R toc_depth: 2\rmobileBanking.Df \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;J://Personalprojects//Blogsite//data//MobileBankinginKenya.csv\u0026quot;, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE )\rmobileBanking.Df \u0026lt;- mobileBanking.Df[,-1] #Remove the number column which is Irrelevant\r1.0.0 Data Inspection\rOnce our sample data set is loaded, we check for features present. We first need to load all the libraries needed for data analysis and manipulation.\n #Load required packages or install if not present.----\rload.libraries \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#39;data.table\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;tidyverse\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;gridExtra\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;corrplot\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;GGally\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ggplot2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;e1071\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;dplyr\u0026#39;)\rinstall.lib \u0026lt;- load.libraries[!load.libraries %in% installed.packages()]\rfor(libs in install.lib) install.packages(libs, dependences = TRUE)\r#Load libraries and flag TRUE\rsapply(load.libraries, require, character = TRUE)\rThe function above takes in a list of required libraries, checks if they are already installed and installs them if not. It then loads all the packages one at a go.\n\r\r\rFigure 1: Loaded packages\r\r\r\r\r1.1.0 Observing the data structure\rdim(mobileBanking.Df)\r## [1] 43 11\rThe data set has 43 rows with 11 Variables. We therefore explore the data types of each variable/column.\n#Check Categorical VS Numeric Characters----\rcat_vars \u0026lt;- names(mobileBanking.Df)[which(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.character))]\rcat_vars\r## [1] \u0026quot;Gender\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Age.Range\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;Have.Bak.Account\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Bank.account.connected.to.MB\u0026quot;\r## [5] \u0026quot;MB.used.for\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Importance\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;Benefit\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Bank.Visit\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;MB.Safety\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Influence\u0026quot; ## [11] \u0026quot;Satisfaction\u0026quot;\rnumeric_vars \u0026lt;- names(mobileBanking.Df)[which(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.numeric))]\rnumeric_vars\r## character(0)\rTo identify the data types, we can check for numeric and categorical variables present in the data. In our case, all the variables in our data set are categorical. We will therefore explore the data from a categorical approach rather than numeric. There exists different visualization methods for different data types. Now that we have established the general structure of the data, we can check for missing values, NAs.\n#Checking data for any missing values\rcolSums(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.na))\r## Gender Age.Range ## 0 0 ## Have.Bak.Account Bank.account.connected.to.MB ## 0 0 ## MB.used.for Importance ## 0 0 ## Benefit Bank.Visit ## 0 0 ## MB.Safety Influence ## 0 0 ## Satisfaction ## 0\rWe have no columns with missing values in our data. We can therefore proceed to analysis without worrying about missing values. In a case whereby there exists NA values, one can choose whether to replace the nulls with the most appropriate values or remove the rows with nulls from the data. This is important for later stages of analysis that include data modelling, like Machine Learning.\n\n\r1.1.1 Data Summary\r#Data Summary----\rsummary(mobileBanking.Df)\r## Gender Age.Range Have.Bak.Account ## Length:43 Length:43 Length:43 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## Bank.account.connected.to.MB MB.used.for Importance ## Length:43 Length:43 Length:43 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## Benefit Bank.Visit MB.Safety ## Length:43 Length:43 Length:43 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## Influence Satisfaction ## Length:43 Length:43 ## Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character\r\nThe base R Summary() function comes in handy at summarizing data. In our case, there is no statistical measures since all our variables are categorical. Note that the function also specifies the specific data types. There are more than enough ways to inspect data structures in R.\n\n\r2.0.0 Getting Insights from the data\r2.1.0 Descriptive Statistics For Categorical Data\rThe main goal of descriptive statistics is to inform data analysts on the main features of either numerical or categorical data, using sample summaries represented as either tables, individual numbers or charts and graphs. Since we only have categorical data, I will illustrate the most used forms of descriptive statistics for the same. However, like I mentioned earlier, there are more than enough ways to analyze data in R.\n\n2.1.1 Frequencies\rFrequencies illustrate the number of occurrences or observations of a particular category in data. We use contigency tables to present this information. In R this can be achieved using the table() function.\nFrom out data, the total distribution of respondents based on gender looks like this;\n#Gender frequencies\r#library(kableExtra)\rtable(mobileBanking.Df$Gender)\r## ## Female Male ## 20 23\rWe can illustrate multiple attributes using cross classification tables such as;\n#library(kableExtra)\r# Cross classification counts for gender by Mobile banking safety opinion\rtable(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety)\r## ## NotAtAll Somewhat Very\r## Female 3 11 6\r## Male 0 19 4\rMultidimensional tables with three or more categories can also be achieved using the ftable() . As an example, let’s check out the number of respondents based on gender, mobile banking safety opinion and how often they visit the bank.\n#Counts by gender, opinion and bank visits\rtable_ \u0026lt;- table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety, mobileBanking.Df$Bank.Visit)\rftable(table_)\r## FewTimesAyear OnceMonth\r## ## Female NotAtAll 3 0\r## Somewhat 11 0\r## Very 5 1\r## Male NotAtAll 0 0\r## Somewhat 15 4\r## Very 4 0\r\n\r2.1.1 Proportions\rProportions are basically contingency tables represented as percentages. From our previous tables, we can do proportions for the same by applying prop.table() to output produced by the *table() function. Proportions for the above will then be;\n#library(kableExtra)\r#Gender frequencies proportions\rprop.table(table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender))\r## ## Female Male ## 0.4651163 0.5348837\r#Percentage idistribution for Gender by mobile banking safety\rprop.table(table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety))\r## ## NotAtAll Somewhat Very\r## Female 0.06976744 0.25581395 0.13953488\r## Male 0.00000000 0.44186047 0.09302326\r#Percentage by gender, opinion and bank visits, rounding off to 2 decimal places\rtable_ \u0026lt;- table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety, mobileBanking.Df$Bank.Visit)\rftable(round(prop.table(table_),2))\r## FewTimesAyear OnceMonth\r## ## Female NotAtAll 0.07 0.00\r## Somewhat 0.26 0.00\r## Very 0.12 0.02\r## Male NotAtAll 0.00 0.00\r## Somewhat 0.35 0.09\r## Very 0.09 0.00\r\n\r2.1.2 Marginals\rMarginals measure counts across columns or rows in a contingency table. Margin.table() gives us the frequencies while prop.table() gives us the percentages. Using our previous examples on frequencies;\n# FREQUENCY MARGINALS\r# row marginals - totals for each gender across mobile banking opinion\rmargin.table(table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety), 1)\r## ## Female Male ## 20 23\r# colum marginals - totals for each gender across mobile banking opinion\rmargin.table(table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety), 2)\r## ## NotAtAll Somewhat Very ## 3 30 10\r# PERCENTAGE MARGINALS\r# row marginals - row percentages across gender\rprop.table(table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety), margin = 1)\r## ## NotAtAll Somewhat Very\r## Female 0.150000 0.550000 0.300000\r## Male 0.000000 0.826087 0.173913\r# colum marginals - column percentages acrossmobile banking opinion\rprop.table(table(mobileBanking.Df$Gender, mobileBanking.Df$MB.Safety), margin = 2)\r## ## NotAtAll Somewhat Very\r## Female 1.0000000 0.3666667 0.6000000\r## Male 0.0000000 0.6333333 0.4000000\r\r\r2.2.0 Visualizing Distributions\rThe code chunk bellow is a function that takes in our data set and plots all the present variables in it. Since we have categorical variable only, we will use bar plots for visualization. They are the most appropriate for categorical data.\n#Loading Data into R toc_depth: 2\rmobileBanking.Df \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;J://Personalprojects//Blogsite//data//MobileBankinginKenya.csv\u0026quot;, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE )\rmobileBanking.Df \u0026lt;- mobileBanking.Df[,-1] #Remove the number column which is Irrelevant\r#Check Categorical VS Numeric Characters----\rcat_vars \u0026lt;- names(mobileBanking.Df)[which(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.character))]\rnumeric_vars \u0026lt;- names(mobileBanking.Df)[which(sapply(mobileBanking.Df, is.numeric))]\r####Convert character to factors----\rlibrary(data.table)\rsetDT(mobileBanking.Df)[,(cat_vars) := lapply(.SD, as.factor), .SDcols = cat_vars]\rmobileBanking.Df_cat \u0026lt;- mobileBanking.Df[,.SD, .SDcols = cat_vars]\r##mobileBanking.Df_cont \u0026lt;- mobileBanking.Df[,.SD,.SDcols = numeric_vars]\r#Functions for Plots---\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rlibrary(gridExtra)\rplotHist \u0026lt;- function(data_in, i) {\rdata \u0026lt;- data.frame(x=data_in[[i]])\rp \u0026lt;- ggplot(data=data, aes(x=factor(x))) + stat_count() + xlab(colnames(data_in)[i]) + theme_light() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust =1))\rreturn (p)\r}\rdoPlots \u0026lt;- function(data_in, fun, ii, ncol=3) {\rpp \u0026lt;- list()\rfor (i in ii) {\rp \u0026lt;- fun(data_in=data_in, i=i)\rpp \u0026lt;- c(pp, list(p))\r}\rdo.call(\u0026quot;grid.arrange\u0026quot;, c(pp, ncol=ncol))\r}\rplotDen \u0026lt;- function(data_in, i){\rdata \u0026lt;- data.frame(x=data_in[[i]], SalePrice = data_in$SalePrice)\rp \u0026lt;- ggplot(data= data) + geom_line(aes(x = x), stat = \u0026#39;density\u0026#39;, size = 1,alpha = 1.0) +\rxlab(paste0((colnames(data_in)[i]), \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Skewness: \u0026#39;,round(skewness(data_in[[i]], na.rm = TRUE), 2))) + theme_light() return(p)\r}\r\n\rVariable Distributions\r#Plotting categorical values----\r#Bar plots\rdoPlots(mobileBanking.Df_cat, fun = plotHist, ii = 1:4, ncol = 2)\r\n\rGender\rIt can be seen that a larger number of respondents were male, this is however by a small margin. If we had a larger data set we could have more female respondents.\n\n\rAge Range\rA majority of respondents were younger guys between age 21-30, followed by the 31-40 age bracket. The least respondents were those above age 41. This could be probably because the older people chose not to participate in the survey as opposed to the younger ones, or that they somehow never got to opportunity to do so. A good example is the medium by which the survey was conducted, which the older people didn’t have.\n\n\rHave Bank Account \u0026amp; Linked To Mobile Banking\rAll the respondents had bank accounts. A very small number had their business bank accounts linked to mobile banking. Majority had linked their current accounts probably due to the convenience that comes with mobile banking like frequent or timeless withdrawals.\n\n\n\rUses Of Mobile Banking, Importance And Benefits\rMost respondents use mobile banking services for making payments. This is followed by cash withdrawals. Airtime purchase and money transfer happen to be the least uses for the service. This could be because they are easily accessible needs unlike cash withdrawal and making payments in terms of mobility convenience.\nMost respondents found mobile banking services very important, probably owing to the affordable cost charges and good service which could mean less usability issues when using the services.\n\n\n\rBank Visits\rWe had most users who visit their banks a few times a year while the least do it once a month. This means that generally, fewer people visit the bank physically. This could be a major impact of mobile banking services.\n\n\rMobile Banking Safety, Influence And Satisfaction\rDespite being majorly satisfied by the services, most respondents did not find mobile banking services very safe. It is also seen as time saving which is probably why we had very few bank visits in general.\n\n\r\r\rConclusion from variable distributions\rIt can be concluded that mobile banking is mainly preferred by younger people, a majority being of the male gender. However, the only benefit most users find from mobile banking seems to be the convenience it brings. Safety is still a major concern.\n\n\rThat’s basically it for exploratory data analysis. I made sure to cover the basics, meaning there’s still much to be added on to this; more visualizations, packages that simplify the whole process etc…This is to be continued. For a detailed documentation on the same, here’s Hadley Wickham’s R for Data Science book you can use as a reference point.\n\r\n\r\r\n\r","date":1564876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580798781,"objectID":"ab9cbfadd2fa5bd2f4fd8d6a895b7e94","permalink":"/post/exploratory-data-analysis/","publishdate":"2019-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/exploratory-data-analysis/","section":"post","summary":"Basics for data preparation","tags":["Twitter","R","Data Visualization"],"title":"Exploratory Data Analysis","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Data Viz","Data Visualization"],"content":"\rMotivation\rThis project contains links to my developed shiny apps you might find helpful…For every new interesting idea I have I’ll build an app. Some might be basic shiny, others might be complex shiny, depending on how important I think they are.

This isn’t entirely true though, in fact, I just made that number up. I could be right because if you think about it, how many decisions would you say you make on a day to day basis? Depending on who you are the above obviously varies widely and you know best. We all make n decisions every day- what to do, eat, buy or hit. The real question however is, do our daily choices solely depend on our consciousness? Are there any other factors at hand that influence our decision making process? Are all these factors, if any, always straight forward choices or do we sometimes get “nudged” into these choices we make?\nNudge theory basically states that; by understanding how people think and what drives their decisions, we can use those factors to steer them into making decisions differently, through positive reinforcement. Research has shown that, by presenting choices differently rather than in a legislative manner, people can be influenced into making specific desired choices. This theory is widely used in behavioral economics by presenting subtle nudge units intended to influence people’s thoughts about financial products. The theory was however initially more of a moral aspect meant to help people make better decisions in life and not as a tool for commercial gain. Over years of practice, different applications of the theory emerged.\nNow that we have a basic understanding of what nudge theory is about, we can explore an applicable example. This post mainly focuses on a short research project I happened to be part of, actually my first hackathon experience hosted by Safaricom PLC. Let’s dive in!\nThe Challenge\rThis photo a team mate took at the hackathon contains a problem statement for the challenge:\n\r\r\rFigure 1: The challenge\r\r\r\r\r\rTools used:\rOur twitter data was fetched using R, I have done a post on setting up a twitter API to fetch twitter data here. R has several packages (such as “tweeteR” and “rtweet”) that one can use to stream data from twitter. Our data cleaning and pre-processing was mainly done in Python.\n\rNote: To keep this post concise, code for the workings has been minimized. The source code for this post can be found here, for anyone interested in trying out the same process. The code is well commented for easier understanding as well.\n\r1.Fetching Data\rThe team agreed on a few terms to query data on from twitter. For an unbiased range of topics, we settled on fetching tweets under trending topics and a few more from random words. We had tweets from or containing the following:\n\r#MenConference2019\n\r“Here”\n\r#r_Stats\n\r“PWC”\n\r#Friday Feeling\r\rA total of 7000 tweets were captured. The data frame had a total of 88 columns which we treated as variables for the research. However, not all variables were used in the research we therefore had to do some data cleaning.

We decided to do with a select few variables we thought would be most appropriate for our case study. We chose the following seven variables:\n\rText - This column contained the actual tweets text.\rVerified - whether or not the user is verified on twitter.\rProtected - Whether a user is or isn’t protected (Locked accounts).\rLocation - Based on our challenge stated in the figure above, this variable was our most important variable. Rows with NULL values for location simply meant that the specific user DID NOT GEOTAG their tweet.\rFollowers Count - Number of followers the user had.\rRetweet Verifie - Whether the tweet had been retweeted by a verified user or not.\rSource - Source of the tweet i.e “Android”, “web client” e.t.c\r\rCode for the data cleanup and variables setting that was done in Python can be found here.\n\n\r2.1 Re-importing Data in R and setting up for the Models\rAfter cleaning up the data, we imported it into R, the code chunk shows a preview of the top 4 rows of the input data.\n Text\r1074 Want to know how to optimize hyper-parameters in Caret with cost-specific functions? #rstats #datascience https://t.co/cupvirSXU9\r1316 via @RichardEudes - Quick Guide to R and Statistical Programming https://t.co/GfyhLMgiuB #analytics, #datascience, #rstats, #statistics https://t.co/Cx3TGJTOoI\r2636 small #rstats trick: if you need to know if a *sorted* variable is equally spaced (e.g., if it\u0026#39;s a contiguous sequence of ints, which was my use case) you can look at the characteristics of diff(x), e.g.\\n\\nsummary(diff(x))\\ntable(diff(x))\r2939 my #ggplot2 flipbook project is online! \u0026lt;U+0001F60E\u0026gt;\u0026lt;U+0001F913\u0026gt;\u0026lt;U+0001F913\u0026gt; Incrementally walks through plotting code (#MakeoverMonday, soon #TidyTuesday plots).

This was an additional variable derived by counting the number of characters in the tweet text.\n\n\r3.Model Specifications\rDue to the nature of our problem,(we had several uncorrelated variables) we decided to do a classification analysis. This means we had to come up with a classifier model to regress n variables based on our dependent variable, the Location variable. The main challenge of classifier models is knowing what really goes on inside the models that leads to the final output. Even with higher levels of accuracy in some models, it is quite difficult o understand the paths of a given model. However, using Random forests and Decision Tree classifiers can give us a graphical representation of the criteria followed by the models to arrive at a given output. Another upper hand of decision tree models is that they require minimal data cleaning, less time consuming. Here is a detailed read on how decision trees work.\n\r\rCreating Train \u0026amp; Test Sets.\rFor the training and test data sets, we randomly split our data set into two sates. Usually, the best practice is to train the model with with a larger proportion of the data set. We therefore took 80% for training and 20% for test purposes.\n\n\rModel Training.\rWe trained our decision tree model to predict a class “location”. Whether a location is geotagged or not geotagged based on whether the user is verified, protected, has over 500 followers, is retweeted by another verified user and the number of characters in their tweet. Bellow is the visual output of the trained model.\n\r\r\rFigure 2: The Tree\r\r\r\rWhen interpreting decision trees, you start at the root node. The root node is the one on top of the decision tree. Since what we want is those nodes with geotagged locations, it is safe to ignore the non-tagged nodes. Note that our highest entropy level was observed on one variable only, the number of characters in the tweet text. This might not always be the case with decision trees though, it is possible to have more than one factor. In such situations, it is best to run several decision trees to build a random forest and make a decision based on the most prevalent variables.\nFor our case, we only focus on what we found:\nAt the top node, we can see the overall probability of a user geotagging their tweets. 75 percent of the users in the training set geotagged their tweets. not\n\rOur second node asks whether the number of characters are more than 134 and goes to depth 2 where we can observe the highest number of users tweeted more than 134 characters at 80 percent with an 80 percent probability of geotagging their tweets.\n\rNode 3 checks if the number of characters in a tweet is less than 134. If yes, head to depth 3, where we can see that 20 percent of users had less than 134 characters with a 50 percent probability of geotagging their tweets.\n\rFinally, looking at depth 4 which originates from the node that checks is number of characters is equal to or more than 122, we can see that 12 percent of users had tweets with character equal to or more than 124, with 88 percent probability of geotagging their tweets.\n\r\r\n3.1 Model Testing and performance accuracy.\rWith our model trained and outputs observed, we were able to run a test with our test subset. Here is our confusion matrix.\n\r\rConfusion matrix\r predict_geotags\rNON-TAGGED TAGGED\rNON-TAGGED 90 248\rTAGGED 2 1043\r\n\rModel Accuracy\r\u0026gt; #performance\r\u0026gt; accuracy_Test \u0026lt;- sum(diag(table_mat)) / sum(table_mat)\r\u0026gt; print(paste(\u0026#39;Accuracy for test is\u0026#39;, accuracy_Test))\r[1] \u0026quot;Accuracy for test is 0.819233550253073\u0026quot;\rFrom the confusion matrix above, we can observe that the model had a true negative of 90 predictions. That is, 90 predictions were correctly predicted as not geotagged. A false positive of 248 predictions was observed where the model wrongly predicted 248 tweets were geotagged whereas in real sense they were not.\nFor the tagged tweets, we had a false negative of 2 predictions against a true positive of 1043 predictions. This means that our model was able to correctly predict 1043 geotagged tweets from the test data. The accuracy of the model turned out pretty good, at an 82 percent accuracy level. The theoretical formula for the accuracy is the proportion of true positives and the true negatives divided by the sum of the confusion matrix.\n\r\\[ Accuracy = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\\]\n\rFor a better accuracy level, the model’s hyper-parameters can be tweaked to improve performance. Another option is implementing a random forest test.\n\n4. Conclusion and Recommendation\rWith our decision tree model, we were able to attain a high level of accuracy for a model that test whether users with tweets containing characters equal to or above 122 are likely to geotag their tweets. Our nudge in this case is the number of characters in a tweet and precisely, 124 or more. Our recommendation therefore would be to encourage users to tweet longer or engage them in trending topics that require one to write more, for example a TT like # MyLifeHistoryInANutshell…-in the hope that a user will eventually geotag their tweet.\n\rCome to think of it, did twitter really increase the number of characters just for tweeps to tweet more and as they said, to get more people to join twitter? I have a theory, it was a NUDGE!\n\r\n\r\rReferences\rBusiness balls official website\n\rThaler, R.H., Sunstein, C.R., and Balz, J.P. Choice Architecture.

You can skip directly to the second section here if you are able to build your own twitter app and get the required authentication keys.\n\r\rIntroduction:\rSocial media usage has grown rapidly over the past few decades. Most social networks we can think of now are so well established, making them a platform where people can not only interact but also a haven for anyone in need of “unstructured” data. With an almost constant rate of increasing users each day, social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have become great sources of data which can be used in the broad field of Data Science:Talk of (those pretty annoying) targeted ads for example…\n\r\r\nWith the help of APIs, we are easily able to get data from such platforms to be used for further analysis.In this article we will go through the preliminaries of text mining in R using Twitter data.The main advantage of these APIs is that the data we will fetch comes in a well-structured format which makes our work easier when crunching.In this case we will use the readily available Twitter API and create our own Twitter app that will then help in fetching the data.\n\n\rCreating a Twitter app\rTo create a twitter app we can use for fetching metadata, we first need to have a Twitter account. We then need to go to the twitter dev site and log in with our user account.\rOn the top right corner should be a drop down menu next to your username, go to APPS. At this point if you are doing this for the first time your Apps section should be blank. Click on “Create an app” to… create an app.\n\r\rWe then have to fill in the form below appropriately. Here is a breakdown of what’s required:\n\rName:\rGive your app a unique name of your choice, e.g UniqueName\rDescription:\rThis can always be changed later, use this to provide a brief note on what your app is all about to be able to distinguish it from other apps you might create in future.\rWebsite:\rThis should be your application’s home page web site. It is however not applicable for most personal apps. Anything goes here e.g https://carlvinjerry.github.io\rCallback URL:\rI would ignore the Callback URL field. If you are allowing users to log into your app to authenticate themselves, you’d enter the URL where they would be returned after they’ve given permission to Twitter to use your app.\r\r\rApp details\n\r\r\nThe remaining fields should be quite straight forward but must be filled. Click “Create” once done and there you have your first twitter app.\rOn your app is a menu with Keys and tokens. These are the most important components since we will need them to access data from the API.Generate both consumer and access tokens (if not readily available) and take note of them. NB: Keys are private property…most of the times\n\r\r\nThe final bit of setting up our twitter app is granting access permissions. We will mostly do fine with read-only if all we need is to fetch data but it can always be changed later.\n\r\r\nNow we can move on to the next step where we set up R to query data from Twitter.\n\n\nPart II\r\r\rSetting up R to fetch twitter data\rWith our twitter app set up in part I above and we are able to get the authentication keys for the API, we can now easily fetch data from twitter in R. The following steps will help us do this:\n\rdiv.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}\r\rPrerequisites:\r\rTwitter API Keys: At this point we already have our twitter app with the required API keys.\rR and an IDE of choice: We also need to have R installed, advisably the latest version. Microsoft’s enhanced R distribution is recommended over the\rbase R but for this specific task either can do just fine. I would recommend R STUDIO for an IDE. One obvious advantage of all these is that they’re open-source tools.\r\r\r\n\r1.Install and Load the required packages in R\rR has a standard set of packages, each with different tasks. You can find some packages for download\nhere. The code chunk below installs and loads the specific packages we need for this task. Take note of comments at each line of code, initiated by an octothorp.\n# Install packages\rinstall.packages(\u0026quot;twitteR\u0026quot;) #------Extracts data from twitter\rinstall.packages(\u0026quot;httr\u0026quot;) #--------Tools for Working with URLs and HTTP\r# We can now load the two packages\rlibrary(\u0026quot;twitteR\u0026quot;)\rrequire(\u0026quot;httr\u0026quot;) #-------------Both require() and library() can be used to call an installed package\r\nNB: Windows users might need to download a certification file and store it in the working directory. This certificate file initiates a handshake between R and the Twitter API.\n# Download \u0026quot;cacert.pem\u0026quot; file\rdownload.file(url = \u0026quot;https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem\u0026quot;, destfile = \u0026quot;cacert.pem\u0026quot;)\r\n\r2.Create and store objects containing the twitter authenticated credentials\rThis is where we invoke the twitter API using the credentials from our app and query the data we need.\n# Authentication keys\rconsumer_key \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;hjksdha08097afnjhaa90uaf\u0026quot;\rconsumer_secret \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;hjksdha08097afnjhaa90uaf\u0026quot;\raccess_token \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;hjksdha08097afnjhaa90uaf\u0026quot;\raccess_secret \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;hjksdha08097afnjhaa90uaf\u0026quot;\r# The above tokens are what we made the twitter app for.\r\n\r3.Query data from twitter\rWe can now go ahead and fetch our data. Due to limitations on the twitter standard apps, it is advisable to store your data in R locally. This will reduce the number of times you have to make requests to fetch data. You will therefore do much more with your app that way regardless of the limitations- Or you can as well buy the premium rights. In my example below, I am fetching data for a user on twitter called @UKenyatta.\n# Connect to Twitter\rsetup_twitter_oauth(consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_secret)\rtweets \u0026lt;- userTimeline(\u0026quot;UKenyatta\u0026quot;, n = 3200) # Standard twitter apps are limited to 3200 tweets per #download session. This could come out less depending on\r# the app\r# create a data frame of the tweets\rUKenyatta_Tweets \u0026lt;- tbl_df(map_df(tweets, as.data.frame))\r# Save tweets for later (and note when saved):\rsave(UKenyatta_Tweets, file = \u0026quot;UKenyatta_Tweets.RData\u0026quot;)\r# You can then access them later at will...\r# load(\u0026quot;UKenyatta_Tweets.RData\u0026quot;)\rYou can now manipulate your data and see what you find out…\n\n\r\r\n\r","date":1548374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580798781,"objectID":"5cdd7964d7776f553ac24d1fdeae48ad","permalink":"/post/data-mining/","publishdate":"2019-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/data-mining/","section":"post","summary":"Part I\r\rThis first section assumes you have no knowledge in building a twitter app to be used for fetching data.
